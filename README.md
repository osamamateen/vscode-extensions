# My Recommended VS Code Extensions - AKA Stuff That Super Charges My VSCode

This is a collection of VS Code extensions I've found super helpful. They range from productivity boosters to things that just make coding a little more fun. Check 'em out!

## The Essentials

- **streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker:** Because typos are the worst. This guy underlines your spelling mistakes so you don't commit code that looks like it was written by a caffeinated squirrel.

- **dbaeumer.vscode-eslint:** Keeps my JavaScript code clean and consistent. It yells at me when I do something silly, which is more often than I'd like to admit.

- **esbenp.prettier-vscode:** Automatically formats my code. I just hit save, and boom, it's beautiful. No more fighting over indentation!

- **tabnine.tabnine-vscode:** AI-powered code completion. It's like having a coding buddy who knows what you're going to type before you do. Sometimes it's a little _too_ good...spooky.

- **eamodio.gitlens:** Git superpowers! See who changed what, when, and why, all within VS Code. Great for figuring out who to blame... I mean, collaborate with! ðŸ˜‰

## Productivity Boosters

- **sleistner.vscode-fileutils:** Makes working with files and folders way easier. Rename, duplicate, move â€“ all the file system stuff you do a million times a day, but faster.

- **ritwickdey.liveserver:** For web developers. Automatically refreshes your browser when you save a file. Super handy for seeing your changes live.

- **ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare:** Collaborative coding! Share your project with someone else and code together in real-time. Great for pair programming or getting help.

- **rangav.vscode-thunder-client:** A lightweight REST API client right in VS Code. Perfect for testing APIs without leaving your editor.

- **formulahendry.code-runner:** Run code snippets directly from VS Code. Supports a ton of languages. Great for quick tests and experiments.

- **wix.vscode-import-cost:** Shows you how big your imports are. Helps you keep your bundle size down and your website fast.

## Little Gems

- **adpyke.codesnap:** Take beautiful screenshots of your code. Perfect for sharing on social media or in documentation. #CodePorn

- **dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets:** React snippets for days! Makes writing React code much faster.

- **pkief.material-icon-theme:** Makes your VS Code icons look awesome. Because who doesn't love pretty icons?

- **equinusocio.vsc-material-theme-icons:** More awesome icons! Gotta have choices, right?

- **chakrounanas.turbo-console-log:** Makes console logging easier and more informative. Because debugging is a necessary evil.

- **usernamehw.errorlens:** Highlights errors and warnings directly in your code. Makes them hard to miss (which is good!).

- **tomoki1207.pdf:** View PDF files directly in VS Code. Sometimes you just gotta look at a PDF, and now you don't have to leave!

- **ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh:** Develop on remote servers without the hassle. SSH into your server and code like it's local.

- **mechatroner.rainbow-csv:** Makes working with CSV files much more pleasant. Rainbow colors for your data!

- **xabikos.javascriptsnippets:** More JavaScript snippets! Because you can never have too many.

- **wallabyjs.quokka-vscode:** Instant feedback for your JavaScript and TypeScript code. See your tests running as you type. Super cool!

This list is always evolving, so I'll probably add more stuff as I find it. Hope you find some of these helpful!

# How to use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/osamamateen/vscode-extensions.git](https://github.com/osamamateen/vscode-extensions.git)
    cd vscode-extensions
    ```

2.  **Run the Installation Script:**

    The included install_extensions.sh script automates the installation process. Make the script executable:

    ```bash

    chmod +x install_extensions.sh
    ```

    Then, run the script:

    ```bash

    ./install_extensions.sh
    ```

    This script will iterate through the list of extensions in extensions.txt and install them using the code command-line tool.

3.  **(Alternative) Manual Installation:**

    If you prefer to install extensions manually, you can find the list of recommended extensions in the extensions.txt file. Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X), search for each extension by name, and install them individually.
