# How to use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/osamamateen/vscode-extensions.git](https://github.com/osamamateen/vscode-extensions.git)
    cd vscode-extensions
    ```

2.  **Run the Installation Script:**

    The included `install_extensions.sh` script automates the installation process. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x install_extensions.sh
    ```

    Then, run the script:

    ```bash
    ./install_extensions.sh
    ```

    This script will iterate through the list of extensions in `extensions.txt` and install them using the `code` command-line tool.

3.  **(Alternative) Manual Installation:**

    If you prefer to install extensions manually, you can find the list of recommended extensions in the `extensions.txt` file. Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X), search for each extension by name, and install them individually.
